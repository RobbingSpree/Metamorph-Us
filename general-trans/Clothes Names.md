While you may know that dress goes spinny, Fashion has been occurring forever, and forever is a long time to try and catch up on. If you’re not already involved in a niche fashion aesthetic you may only know that clothes can come in the torso covering or the leg covering kind (or the exotic: cover-all).

 This zine intends to educate you on some stuff you may want to find later and try on (or just fantasise about owning), since a lot of transfemme identity comes from the ability to express yourself physically in a way that pleases you, some people will have issues finding clothes that actually do it for them. This zine and it’s non-exhaustive list of clothes to go search pictures of is for you.

 So with all the further ado removed for brevity and so we can get straight into the list, let’s start with garments designed to cover the top half of your body:

---

 Blouse: essentially a shirt, but only comes in women’s cuts, there are no rules for what is or isn’t a blouse, all rules have been broken over time. It's supposed to hang from the shoulders and gather at the waist, but no promises.

 Bolero: a garment that almost only covers the arms and a strip of fabric over the back. Good for emphasising the bust and making the arms look slender.

 Smock: a shirt that hangs from the shoulders and has a baggy chest for ease of movement.

 Middy: imagine a twink in the 19th century British navy, this sleeveless shirt is what they would ware.

 Crop Top: often a shirt that ends about 5-10cm above the true waist. Can be elasticised or not at the bottom, designed to make the torso seem longer and show off bust/abs/tummy.

Slip: very soft and slippery singlet with spaghetti straps over the shoulder. Used to hide the flesh and bra through transparent shirts or make rougher material nicer on the skin.

 Tunic: a button-up shirt (often with no sleeves). Comes in either the fitted or sack shaped varieties. The second you're intended to wear with a belt to get the fitted waist. Exaggerates or minimises bust depending on bow it's worn. Needs a slip or shirt underneath.

 Now that we’re done with tops, lets move on to what is found a lot more amongst transfemmes: Bottoms.

 Skort: A skirt with athletic shorts built in so you never have to choose between short shorts and a tiny skirt. Very common in tennis.

 Maxi Skirt: A skirt that goes from the true waist to the ankles, makes your legs look longer but also hides specifically what your legs look like.

Pencil Skirt: A narrow and tight-fitting skirt, generically the hem should sit at or just below the knees. Your legs should look like a pair of pencils sticking out of the bottom. Hard to run in.

 Mermaid Skirt: Like if you attached a miniskirt to the bottom of a pencil skirt. It's supposed to imply a mermaid tail, but since those are fictional it can do anything.

 Petticoat: the name makes you think it's a small jacket, but it's actually and underskirt to make a skirt worn over it look fuller and puffer. Made of several layers of mesh like wide wave fabric. Don't machine wash.

 And the things that can cover all of you at once, (there’s not really a commonly used name for these and it’s a mix of stuff that has pant legs and skirts):

 Pinafore: A skirt with a panel that covers from the waist to the bust and then straps that go over the shoulder and down the back to attach to the skirt, the panel and straps are sometimes removable.

Salopet: Very similar to a Pinafore but it can be pants at the bottom instead of a skirt.

 JSK (Jumper Skirt): a dress that has no sleeves and has shoulder straps, it's intended to wear a shirt under it, and an underskirt. A related item is the jumper dress, which appears to be related to the Pinafore, but fashion trends makes it difficult to know where boundaries lie.

 OP (One-Piece): a dress with sleeves, it's designed to be an entire outfit.

 Dungaree/Overalls/bib-and-brace/coverall: a panel from true waist to collarbone with straps going over the shoulder, connected to high waisted pants. Often leaves a deep arm scye from armpit to hip, designed to fit larger items under it or show off a lot of skin.

 Tent dress: hangs from just above the bust, had no shaping except that it is wider at the bottom that the top. Obfuscate the torso entirely.

 Empire line: a dress that splits the top and bottom half exactly under your bust. It can have almost any designs above and below the underbust, but expect a flowy and lose skirt.

 A line: a dress that is close fitting from shoulder to waist and then tries to look like a capital A from there down on the skirt. Won't suit all body types if your torso length doesn't suit that design.

 Sundress: more defined by the lightweight and breathable fabric than the cut of the garment. But since it's designed for warmer weather it tends to have a plunging neckline or back or both. Great for spinning.

 Shift: a loose dress that hangs from the shoulders with darts in at the bust (which sort of gives it a look of hanging from the bust). Suits tall and thin people because it implies a body that isn't seen so the viewer's imagination does the heavy lifting while you're just carrying the dress.

 Princess line: a dress that uses pre-planning to make a fitted bodice with long panels from the shoulder/armpit to the hem rather than darts or a new set of panels starting from the waist.

 Drop waist: Nothing is set in stone for a drop waist, other than the waist is “incorrectly” put lower to make you appear taller. Works great with leggings in my opinion since you'll want your legs to look longer to stay proportional.

Playsuit: great until you have to use the bathroom. Overalls with a button front to the waist. Used to be called a leisure suit.

Accessories:

There are an infinite number of possible accessories, this shall be a measly and finite list of items mostly associated with shapewear and silhouette blocking. If you get into any subculture or aesthetic they normally have a subset of common accessories for style, these can often be found in those styles (but they'll probably have a different name)

Corset Belt: unlike a corset this isn't supposed to provide shaping to your torso and is more a rectangle to break up patterns or colours and hold shirts tucked into a waistband. Worn normally under the bust where you don't bend.

 Glossary:

 This zine contains a lot of technical jargon, it’s just required when describing the difference between a jacket and bolero.

So here’s a list of technical terms used and their meaning:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Dart|A fold that has been stitched together to sculpt 3D shape into a 2D bit of fabric|
|Drape|A quality of the fabric to hold its shape against gravity, a lot of drape means the fabric is loose and wavey, little drape is|
|Gather|Bunching of fabric used in sculpting, makes a garment tighter in one part, is often elasticated|
|Hang|The highest part of the body the garment lays directly upon, affected by the drape of a fabric|
|Panel|The rectangles and circles that get sewn together into a garment|
|Waist|Where your torso is narrowest under your ribs|
|Spaghetti Straps|A thin strap that goes over the shoulder, normally less than 1cm in width and the same colour and often fabric as the rest of the bodice|
|Bodice|The section of a garment that covers the torso, traditionally it’s the torso part of a dress.|
|Scye|The armhole (and sometimes leghole)|
|Hem|Where a garment ends, specifically where the edge is folded back on itself and sewed down to prevent fraying|
