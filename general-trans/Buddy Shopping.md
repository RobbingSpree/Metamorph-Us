Version 1: Go digital Baybeee

Start by organising a time to be in a voice call with access to a computer or phone with internet access.Â 

Send your Buddy your photos and your favourite colour to wear.

Pick a category of clothes you want them to look at (like dress, shirt pants).

Use a search engine to find a nearby big box store to you and tell your Buddy the URL for their online site (it should be short enough to just read out since they want old people to type it out from their catalogue).
