If you've been raised as one gender presentation and you've not had much opportunity to work out how to organise an outfit outside that box.

So here are some hard and fast rules on putting together a femme outfit.

Take note, while these are framed as rules, they're more "guidelines". You can achieve great results by ignoring them or breaking them, but it requires intent and purpose to know how or when to do so. So for now follow the rules, but why these rules exist shall be left as an exercise for the reader.

  

Patterns: 

You should try to learn two things about patterns: how busy they are and what direction they go in. 

For a standard outfit you don't want to have more than one busy pattern nor do you want patterns that go in different directions.

Busy in this case how information dense the pattern is, a very close pattern alone doesn't make it busy, it needs a lot going on. If you could describe a pattern as sticker-bomb then it's probably busy and you should go with block colours for the rest of the outfit.

Direction is harder to define, stripes have a direction along the stripe. Some patterns don't have a direction (no direction also can be a direction), like grid based stuff or tartans. Generally if you have a direction on one article of clothing that's visible have the rest not be a perpendicular direction (Stripped Underwear doesn't need to match).

What is hard to define is dresses or overalls that have a pattern all the way down them that changes how busy it is as it goes, that's already getting a bit too much for these basic rules so you'd have to experiment and see what looks good with it, but the method is start with nothing else busy and start adding accessories to try to compliment the design. 

  

Colour: 

Sorry bud, but this section is essentially colour theory. 

For this you're also going to need to know about saturation.

Saturation means how vibrant a colour is and how quickly you notice it amongst other colours 

When picking an outfit, starting with something vibrant that the rest of the outfit compliments is a good strategy.

Then find the colour of your garment on the colour wheel and either get clothes that are adjacent to it or form an equilateral triangle with it.

There are more advanced techniques for finding suitable colours that go together, but this is a basics how to.
