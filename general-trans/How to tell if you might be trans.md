Actually, since I have your attention. A good first step after coming to the conclusion you’re trans (or some other fun kind of gender non-conforming person), is to go look at a list of all possible labels for sexuality and gender identity (a good one if at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gender_identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gender_identities) go find anything that sounds fun and google memes for it to see if you like the vibe) and find 4-5 that seem to fit you and try them on.
