OK, so body con (short for contouring) is comes in two styles: Adding and subtracting.

You add padding to build onto your siluette, for example give larger looking hips or a more plump rump. Or use breast forms to build a larger bust than you currently have (there are breast forms that are designed to be put on top of existing breasts to increase bust size and shape).

  

Subtractive body con isn't actually subtracting, more squeezing into a similar shape.

Coresttes and waist sinchers will change your shape to look either more slender or more like an hourglass figure

  

But like with a bust binder that a transmasc person would use, you can't wear these for extended periods of time due to the pressure they put on bones and joints

  

There's also some body con stuff that's both at once, with hip pads and waist sinching or tummy smoothing in the same garment
