A spoof of a splat book for D&D prestige classes from 3.5e

Prestige Class: Transfemme

Requirements: 3lv of boy or boy sub-class
  

Description: A Transfemme has through either rigorous study, experimental ends or sheer force of will managed to gain a glimpse beyond their previously known possibilities of gender.

Level 1: 

Estrogen Beam: as the transfemme starts building up estrogen in their body they are able to release the excess estrogen in the form of an energy projectile. It deals 1d6 gender damage per level of Transfemme the character has reached and can be done as a bonus action if they have not moved this turn.

Level 2: 

Broken mirror: once per day, a transfemme able to make a minor modification to their body equal to using a disguise kit, however they can make the change permanent by making the same change twice in a row. 

At level 2 a Transfemme also gains advantage on deception skill checks. 

Also once per day they can change their true name, doing so breaks any geas they may be under or breaks any illusion cast on them by other character.  

Level 3:  

Egg Cracker: Once per long rest a transfemme is able to make a psychic attack on the mind of a creature they can see and know the name of. The attack is resisted by Charisma, a failed save causes the target's true name to change and they become dazed. A successful save prevents the targeted creature from making hostile actions towards the Transfemme and causes them to be seen as an ally until they make any hostile actions themselves. 

Level 4: 

Estrogen Barrarge: due to intense amounts of estrogen in their body a Tranfemme is able to mark a location with a sigil. When a creature enters 5ft of the sigil the transfemme may spend a bonus action to trigger a barrage of beam attacks. That 5ft circle surrounding the creature that set off the Skill is considered difficult terrain and lasts 5 rounds. Any creature that starts or ends their turn in this field takes 3d6 gender damage and makes a wisdom save (DC 14), a failed save causes their true name to change and to transform into an ideal physical body for 5d4 rounds. While transformed the target holds no hostility to the Transfemme and may be convinced to fight by their side (as per a ruling from the GM).  

Level 5:  

Gender Norm: At the pinicle of femmedom the Transfemme is able to establish dominion over gender for an area around them. If they spend an hour to cast as a ritual any creature within 30ft of the Transfemme must follow an arbitrary behavoir guideline as chosen when the ritual is cast. 

If cast as a spell action the effects last for 5 rounds instead.  

Behavioural guidelines can include restrictions to how combat starts or how hostilely creatures that have not met the Transfemme before will treat them on first meeting.  

Behavioural Guidelines cannot completely prevent a character from taking specific actions but can act as gates to impeded them. (e.g. introducing themselves via name before engaging in physical combat or providing a meal before rigorous activity)  

Creatures are innately aware of Behavioural Guidelines they are under the effect of.
