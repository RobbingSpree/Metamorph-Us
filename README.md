Total Zine projects: 11

Update 03/08/25:
I realized I'd essentially lost track of this project as too much of it had been split over too many locations so this has now been gathered in one spot for my own needs.
As such details are scares while I work more on translating the files to markdown than proof-reading and doing any further work in making progress.
Once I get done importing and fixing general formatting issues I'll go back and work out what still needs work.
