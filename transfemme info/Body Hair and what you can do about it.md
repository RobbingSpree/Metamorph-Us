You may be in one of three situations if you're transfemme and looking to remove some body hair:

- You didn't do a testosterone based puberty and have fine hair covering your body
- You did do a testosterone based puberty and have coarse hair covering some of your body
- Your body is fun and you have a mix of coarse and fine hair in places on your body

We'll be listing below some tools to temporarily remove body hair, but first some basic guidelines on hair removal.
  
- When removing hair as effectively as possible you want short hair, so go get a cheap electric beard/body hair trimmer to shorten longer hair to stubble. 
- Hair removal should be accompanied by a moisturiser routine, since your body hair helps keep ambient air from pulling moisture out of your skin you'll want to help put some back, it'll also keep the smooth feeling for longer after a shave/removal.
- Body hair is always less noticeable to others than to you, don't feel pressured to maintain any level of hairlessness unless it brings you joy


As a note from the author, I, occasionally, will shave my legs, chest and tummy, but I don't have the dedication to stay clean shaven and only do it when it's fun. Body hair has a lot of benefits to your body in maintaining a comfortable temperature and resistance to slight breezes when outdoors or when not wearing several layers.

Hair removal might seem like a lot of effort: and it can be, so why would you want to indulge?

- Some people associate a lack of hair with femininity and will indulge in anything they perceive to be feminine.
- Sometimes you want to wear a particular garment and it’s sleek lines against your body can be dampened with the presence of hair.
- If you have particularly long body hair it can make wearing some clothes uncomfortable or painful
- You really don’t like the halo of fuzz you get when light strikes your body hair

AND MANY MORE PERSONAL REASONS!! 

It’s a good idea to work out why you want to give hair removal a go as you might not need to use the more permanent methods detailed below, find out what suits you best.

Let's get to down to business, hair removal comes in two types: 

- Removal of above surface hair
    
- Removal of the hair follicle 
    

Removing the follicle gives you a longer downtime before you'll see any regrowth so it can be seen as better, but since it's below the surface of your skin methods are often more intense. So don’t think there’s no downsides to those approaches.

We'll start with above surface techniques:

## Non-Permanent Options

### Not removing anything:

Before we get onto removing any of the hair, we should consider the option of just making the hair harder to see or simply using moisturizer to soften your skin. If you don’t have particularly coarse body hair you can get good results by bleaching or making blonde your body hair. If you can make your body hair closer in colour to your skin tone they’ll be even harder to see.

Since it’s the same chemical as bleaching your head hair all you need is a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide and a bit of time. If the effect doesn’t seem to take that’s ok, multiple attempts will stack and have a visible effect, but leave at least 2 days between each attempt to prevent issues with chemical burns.

When it starts regrowing after a few weeks you can apply the same mix and re-dye the roots.

It does have some risks, if you leave the creme on your body for too long you can get chemical burns and it can cause your body hair to get brittle and break (but some may think that’s a good thing).


Pros:
- Cheap
- Works for people with sensitive skin

Cons:
- Not ideal for some skin tones
- Doesn’t remove the hair
- Requires regular effort to maintain the effect

### Just shaving:

Using a razor to remove body hair is a common practice cause it gets quick results and isn't very painful. Again, make sure you've already shortened your hair before trying to shave with a razor since most razors marketed as being for this job will quickly clog up with hair if you didn't shorten it beforehand (to shorten it use an electric beard trimmer or head hair trimmer). And once they are shorter they'll stick straight out and not bend when pushed making them easy to shave very close to the skin. 

As for technique, it might seem smart to shave against the grain to get as close a shave as possible. But that’s just better at causing nicks and cuts since it can pull the skin with it and up into the path of the blade, a shave along the grain should feel smoother when you’re done.

Modern razors are a lot harder to cut yourself with than a straight razor, you don't want to press down with the razor, hold it to your skin but try not to apply pressure and try to get it to glide along the surface.

It's very easy to miss parts of your body when you do this in the shower so some people will cover themselves in lather from a body scrub to make it more of a game of removing the colour of the bubbles than tracking down all the hairs.

If you miss some don't worry, if you have time, dry off, give your body about an hour and then hop back in the shower to finish the job, maybe use highlighter to outline where you missed since that’ll wash off with ease.

Pros:
- Reliable results that get better with experience
- Quick and cheap

Cons:
- Time consuming since you need to touch every hair with a small razor
- Needs to be done regularly for desired results

Works best on: Coarse Hair

### Hair Removal Cream:

I don’t recommend this method, it’s imprecise and results seem to vary wildly from person to person depending on the makeup and shape of their hair. The science of it says it uses a chemical that reacts with hair to dissolve whatever it touches, resulting in an even smoother feel than shaving.

However, since you can’t apply it to just the lowest part of your hairs it’ll also be attempting to uselessly melt the ends of your hairs too.

If you have coarse body hair this might not work fast enough before the same chemical starts to try to dissolve your skin and cause chemical burns.

If you want to give it a go, keep a clock nearby or play songs you know the length of to keep track of how long it’s been on you for since the bottle it came in should have the max time written on it to let it sit on your skin for.

The steps on the bottle normally follow the guidelines of: 

- Apply with a glove or cloth 
- Generously cover body part with cream
- Wait and keep out of water
- It’ll start smelling terribly and getting warm/hot before it has made an impact, but the smell/temp is a sign it’s starting to work
- Enthusiastically remove all traces of the cream once the time is up because again: chemical burns

Don’t use it if you have any external injuries or wounds, cause again again: chemical burns.

Also, don’t use it on your face, genitals, or butt (the skin there is different than your arm/legs/torso and reacts unpredictably)

Pros: 
- Very smooth results when you get them
- Quicker than shaving for a large area (like a whole leg)

Cons:
- Unreliable on coarser or thicker hair
- The smell can be a bit traumatic

Works best on: Fine Hair

### Waxing:

Again, you want to have short hairs before trying waxing since you only want to pull from as close to the root as possible for physics related reasons.

This one doesn’t need to be done while bathing, after a warm bath/shower is good since your skin will be relaxed and can take the punishment of this process better.

Waxing can hurt since you’re applying adhesive to your hair and skin but you only want to pull on the hair.

People I know who’ve had good results with this method barely let the wax melt before applying it, letting it re-solidify and then removing it again so it doesn’t have a chance to get a good grasp on their skin.

It might be worth going to a salon or parlour and have a professional do it to get some experience on what it’s like without having to be responsible for causing yourself pain at the same time. 

Pros:
- It works and does exactly what's promised if done right
- Longest results for cheapest cost

Cons:
- Required skill floor can lead to injury easier than most other methods
- For all that effort it's not permanent

Works best on: All hair types as long as its short

## Permanent Options

### Laser Hair Removal:

This one can really only be done by a professional, so the cost will be higher, also it only works on dark hairs, so once done with it, you’ll still grow blonde hairs as before.

Laser hair removal uses infrared light to mess with the cell that grows the hair into thinking it’s been burnt so it stops trying to grow hair entirely. The process fires infrared light at the hairs, dark hairs will pass the heat energy to the root and burn it, blonde hairs will reflect/refract it and do nothing. The one also only affects the follicles that are currently growing, and your hair cells swap out which is growing about once per month, so you’ll need more than one session to get the results you want. At quickest I’ve seen complete results after 6 months with small patches left to need treatment due to how dense the hair was or how difficult the area is to get a clean shot at it.

There is pain with this method since you’re being burnt by a laser, but the pain is normally very temporary if the technician is good at their job.

The after-care on this method and electrolysis is a bit odd, because the hairs stay where they are once burnt you'll need to exfoliate to remove the hairs, they may show as an odd rash while your body tries to spit them out.

Pros:
- After a few rounds you'll have almost no dark hairs until the next month
- Very long term effects

 Cons:
- Does feel like its having no effect for the first few visits
- Only works on darker hairs

Works best on: Dark stubble

  

### Electrolysis:

A similar technique to Laser Removal, except rather than having infra-red radiation get absorbed by dark hairs to burn the root, we’re discharging electricity to try and do the same thing.

Same as Laser this requires several treatments to get permanent results, but it has less restrictions on what kinds of hairs it can assault. I’ve not done this one myself yet, so I don’t have any tips yet, the rest of this is what I’ve learned while researching if it would suite my needs.

Like laser removal it will require monthly visits for 6-8 months to get the permanent results, and if the technician doing the treatment misses an area you’ll have to wait that entire cycle to finish before you get to see which spots they missed.

Also, since it’s discharging electricity over a bunch of follicles at once, denser parts of your hair may cause it to fail to reach all the follicles, meaning you’ll have to do further treatments regardless.

But once it’s done, like lazer, it shouldn’t grow back ever.


Pros:
- Permanent results
- Works on all skin tones

Cons:
- Always painful
- Dense hair (like a moustache area) can impair the device 

Works best on: Everything that isn’t the moustache

  

### Chemical Burns on Purpose (AKA Chemical Treatment):

A harder to find offering with no standard name, this is often called a chemical treatment or an alkaline treatment, but it’s essentially just hair creams applied professionally such that it first melts the hair down to the follicle, and then causes chemical burns to the root to prevent it from growing again. 

Laser and Electrolysis can be done quite quickly due to the technician needing to just touch all the skin with a device, this treatment does require waiting for chemical burns to slowly happen, so it can feel like it takes a random amount of time at first, but as you have more of it done you’ll get an idea how long a treatment takes and can plan for it better.

Like the previous permanent methods it has restrictions on how effective it is, this is certainly a gentler process and rather than waiting for the hairs to fall out after the treatment they’ll be gone as part of it. But it requires more treatments more frequently to get the same result.

Chemical approaches also have the weakness that if they can’t attack the hair themselves fast enough other techniques might be needed to clear the way to the root instead, so if you have hair that is accidentally resistant to being melted you might be refused service for this or have to do additional treatments (like waxing) to remove the hairs which may put you off since the “no excruciating pain” might have been a selling point.

After 6-8 months of treatments, in some offerings I saw this as being a fortnightly thing, you should have permanent removal of all hair from the treated area. Due to the more frequent treatments it is a bit more reliable at not missing any patches.

  

Pros:
- Permanent results
- Not as much pain

Cons:
- More frequent treatments
- Described as physically unpleasant
- A bit difficult to get details on if it’ll work for you

Works best on: people with time
