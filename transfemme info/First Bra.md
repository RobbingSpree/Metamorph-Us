Getting your first bra might seem daunting, there’s all those sizes to work out, you might also hear that bra sizing is very inconsistent and unreliable. But for a human with burgeoning breasts you’ll need support and protection that a bra offers, so let’s make some assumptions instead.

We need to work out only 2 things before we start going bra fishing: Waistband Size and Bust Size. We’ll get them in that order.

For both we’ll need either a soft measuring tape used in tailoring or crafts, if you don’t have that string and a hard measuring tape/ruler work, but know it’ll be less accurate so aim to re-do the measurements later with a more appropriate tool.

We will be aiming to get a bra that fits in as few tries as possible, once we get a size we think is correct you’ll go and buy a bra, discussed in more detail later in this pamphlet, and wear it for a while to see how correct our sizing guess was and try to only need one additional bra purchase to get one that fits well.

To get your bra size we need two measurements: The Waist and The Bust. Your Waist for a bra is the band at the bottom of the bra that is used to hold it in place, this is assumed to be towards the bottom of your rib cage and often the most narrow part of your chest. The Bust is the opposite, nipple height and often the most broad part of your chest below your armpits.

To measure each, take the measuring tape and draw it around you and hold it as a closed circle so it’s flat against your skin of your nipples and back. Use a mirror, if you can, to make sure the tape is as level as you can get it, but make sure to not dig it into you. Get the measurement in inches if you can or just convert afterwards from cm.

If we subtract your bust in inches from your waist in inches we get your cup size, with a difference of less than 1 inch it’s A cup, with every inch difference it’s one cup larger. As you develop a larger chest you’ll need to do the bust measurement whilst bending over to take gravity pulling your nipples down out of the mix, but for any cup size below a C the difference shouldn’t be enough to worry about.

To turn our waist measurement into the waistband size it is all based on the same logic, the numbers just start counting from different spots. We’ll go with an imaginary waist size of 39”.

For USA this would be a size 16  
For Europe this would be a size 49

For Aus and NZ it would be a size 20

For every inch more or less it’s one size up or down respectively. Most shops only stock clothes in increments of 2 sizes, so you may need to buy a size above and below to see what seems to fit you best.

| Inches      | …   | 39  | 40  | 41  | 42  | …   |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USA Size    | …   | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | …   |
| Europe Size | …   | 49  | 50  | 51  | 52  | …   |
| Aus NZ Size | …   | 20  | 21  | 22  | 23  | …   |

For your first bra we’re assuming you don’t have a lot of chest development yet, but that’s ok after 6-12 months you’ll need to do this again to get sizing for new bras due to growth. We’ll be going looking for a sports bra first since we want to confirm the waistband size we worked out is correct. Most Sports bras only size based on waistband so we can go buy a cheap one and wear it for a bit to make sure our measurements weren’t too wrong.

You’ll want a larger size if:

●   The waistband rides up or roll up while wearing it

●   It feels uncomfortably tight while wearing after a few hours

You’ll want a smaller size if:

●   The waistband seems to gape if you bend forward or turn

Some bras can gape more or fit worse they came with pads and you’ve removed them for a more stealth look, make the above checks with those included pads in if they’re removable before assuming the size is wrong.

We’re just buying sports bras first since they have elastic in the waistband and really only need one size, for bras with hooks instead they’ll relax over time, you want to buy one where it’s comfortable for you to wear it on the loosest setting when it’s new and for it to need to be put on tighter hooks over time as the waistband fabric expires.

Remember we’re buying bras at first for the protection they offer your nipples and chest while you first develop breasts, you don’t need much if any support. As time goes on and you need more support you’ll need to learn about different types of shoulder straps and cup shapes and sizing for those bras will involve more measurements.
