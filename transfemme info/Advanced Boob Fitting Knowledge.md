So you have boob, congratulations. However like all machines: they require some amount of knowledge and understanding for maintenance and everyday use. This zine will cover some of the details you might want to know in your ongoing ownership of your very own pair of funbags.

Because there is no “average” human there is no “average pair” of knockers in this zine we won't make any assumptions about your shape, size or situation, but this does mean we'll have probably more maths and measurements than one would realistically need, but the author likes maths so that’s what you get.

### Section 80085: breast roots and underwires

The breast root is the arc that the bottom edge of your breast makes against your chest. For those of us with perky and non-pendulous breasts it's very easy to find and measure as you can just see the arc under each boob. The length of a breast root is the part of the circumference around your boob from your armpit, around the bottom, and back up to the other side of the boob at an equal height to the point you started. It's essentially the edge of what is considered boob and what is considered chest. 

Why do you want to know that the length of your breast root? Well you know that thing where you work out your bra cup size, but when you go to buy a new bra somehow the new bra doesn't fit properly? Knowing the length of your breast root and your cup size can help you size up or down in a style to find one that will fit.

What we want is a general idea of the ratio of how wide compared to how tall the curve is of the breast root. If it's much wider than it is tall you might need to size up in cup size to what your measurements would suggest. Bra manufacturers aren't making bras to your size, they're making a bunch of estimates on what size and shape “most” boobs are and building their bras to cover that. This is part of why some people find one brand doesn't fit them when others do for bras.

### Key words used in Bra technology:

##### Halter (Halter Neck):

A style of support that goes around the neck rather than over the shoulders to attach to a waistband. Also used in shirts for situations of the same design. Used to pretend bras aren’t present by obfuscating the straps.

##### Fillet insert:

A type of padding, used against the bottom face of your breast to lift it and make it appear bigger. Best used in fuller cup bras so they have no chance to escape.

### What does an underwire even do?

While they might feel like painful additions if you ask your ribs, but an underwire does have a purpose. Structurally speaking, Bras have three points of contact to use for stability: The waistband and the two over the shoulder straps. Since bras are mass manufactured and not made to your shape either of those three points can fail and the bra can either be a pain to wear or your boobs can fall out. 

An underwire is reinforcement to the waistband, with no elastic between where it sits and where your chest curves around to the back it is able to sit pretty stably on your chest acting as a floor for the rest of the bra and your boobs to sit on. 

**However, due to the mass manufacturing detail, underwires can be the wrong shape for your chest, and can be quite painful as such.**

An underwire is supposed to follow the breast root and not sit on any breast tissue. If an underwire is the wrong shape or size for you it can either
- try to stab you: 
	- in the sternum
	- in the side or armpit
	- in the arm
	- in the opposite side boob
- Or it can sit too high on your chest and put undue pressure on your breast tissue (which can cause developmental issues while they’re in a growth phase).

### Bra types and how to tell them apart

Bras come in many shapes and sizes. We have a fairly standard bra nowadays (underwire support, latches with hooks at the back, cups have padding, shoulder straps that can extend) but that's not the only type of bra to exist. So this shall be a non-exhaustive list on what bra styles can be called, what they're for, and what they're to be worn with.

#### Not bras - no underwire, no padding, no support, staps normally don't extend

There's a few garments that do some of the function of bras (protect from chaffing and hide nipples) but without any of the support and shaping that bras tend to do. These types of crop singlets with spaghetti straps are good for people not planning to wear a bra or wearing one and needs extra help hiding the nipples or bra.

#### Bralette - no underwire, no padding, fabric support, small cups

A babies-first-bra style bra, meant to not be too tight on the waistband and to identify if there's any issues wearing a bra in the future. Since it's got small cups and no support it's mostly there to smooth out one's siluette while growing early buds. The author reccomends a sports bra with the padding removed instead as a first bra for transfemme people as bralette's might not come in your size and sports bras do a better job being subtle for boymoding.

#### Boob Tube - no underwire, padding optional, full cups, no straps

A boob toob is not a tube for your boobs. It’s a tube for you. This small band of fabric does exactly one thing: cover the nipples. Due to their lack of structure there’s no way they can offer any serious support. Some modern sportswear use pleating to try and establish shaping so you don’t look like you have a mono-boob sitting on your chest.

Falls off easily, good only for relaxing. Never trust a boob tube, they will always betray you.

#### Sports Bra - no underwire, removable padding, full cups, unchanging straps

Jump around. Jump around. Jump up jump up and your boobs won’t fall out. Sports bras, unlike most other bras on this list, are designed more for compression than support. Such that you can run and (since your breasts can’t jangle all over) your boobs won’t bounce as much. Good for a more stealth look with their lack of flare (you can find some with serious flare if you want it).

#### Stick-on Bra - no underwire, not much of anything really

These overgrown stickers are for very specific outfits. If a garment provides a little built in support you can use a Stick-on bra to cover the nipples and give them a little bit of control. If the stickers connect in the middle that’s all you get in terms of support (as you might not believe how much your breasts jangle independent of one another when out of a bra, but people seeing you on the street will). 

Good to wear with special garments and for fun.

#### Minimizing Bra - no underwire, padding on top, full cups

Sometimes you don’t want to look like you have boobs, and for that you look to minimizing bras. If you have fun-sized funbags you might not need to seek out specialized bras and simply taking the padding out of a Sports Bra could get the job done. But for some of us, we need to burst the bubbles. Minimizing bras try to squash a breast close to the chest and use padding to blend their shape to just look like pecs (muscly pecs tend to sit higher than breasts so smooshing them flat and up helps to get that look).

Once you get too big, nothing can truly hide those bad buddies, but a minimizing bra can still make them look a bit smaller.

#### T-Shirt Bra - Underwire, non-removable padding, full cups

A bra designed with an understanding of textiles in modern clothes. Normal polycotton blend shirts disagree with lacy, decorated bras and can catch on them in unflattering ways, in addition the seam around the top of a cup on a bra can appear as a crease or lump through some shirts. The T-shirt Bra aims to fix only those two problems. 

With a waistband that smoothly transitions from skin to itself so a shirt shows no sign of its presence, and the top of the cup doing a similar job. The T-shirt bra aims to be invisible, but assumes you aren't wearing anything low cut.

#### Balconette Bra - Underwire, low in the cup padding, ¾ cups

A balconette bra (Or a Balcony Bra if we’re not being French) wants you to look like you're some kind of stacked hottie. There's a lot of shelf for your breasts to sit on and it does what it can to lift and separate the breasts to show of all cleave possible. 

While it might seem like the name is a pun, it’s actually descriptive, the neckline (the line along the top of the garment when worn) appears straight, like a balcony. 

This is the most generic bra under current fashion.

#### Demi bra - Underwire, non-removable padding, small cups, bad for running

Designed to show off as much breast while pretending the bra isn’t present. A demi bra’s cup will either barely cover the nipple, or just fail to cover it at all. As such it only has padding on the bottom half of the breast to try lift it a little and give it something soft to bounce on.

Unlike a balconette bra it’s very focused on shaping the bust to appear more busty, it works well with plunging necklines and garments that want to show off your bust.

#### Pushup Bra - Underwire, so much padding, half cups

Pushup bras want to also push in. Up and in toward the middle of your chest. To get some good looking cleavage they need your breasts to touch, as such they will often have cups that offer no coverage in the middle to make your possible visible cleavage as deep as possible for plunging necklines.

They can’t do magic however and if you don’t have enough breasts to smoosh together or up using your hands a bra won’t be able to make that happen. Some brands will advertise a more extreme pushup bra, but it’s just fillet fillers at that point. They’re still not magic.

#### Prosthetic Bra - no set details

Some people lose one or both of their tits. And there’s bras that provide them with the shape and weight of boobs so they don’t look lopsided.

Prosthetic bras can be pockets to put a breast form in (such that it doesn’t need to be stuck to the chest), or can be the whole prosthetic themselves.

Expect them to have full cups and be expensive.
