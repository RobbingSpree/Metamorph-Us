The pride of many fem presenting (or closeted) trans folks is their bust. But for anyone who's not yet able to access medication or surgery, or just wants to play around with their very own pair, imagination can only get so far.

To get back into the real of the real, we'll have to make our own. 

Presented here are three methods to make breast forms, increasing in cost from free, to quite cheap, to best money can get outside of actual silicone breastforms you can buy off the internet (but we're assuming you might have people you don't want asking where any packages come from and what they are for why you're making your own).

Before we get started: 

You should have an idea how big a set of knockers you want to make for yourself. Partly so you can male them both the same size, and partly cause you'll want a bra to put them in and hold them in place. 

You can only go so far with some sock glue and a dream.

We already have another guide for sizing yourself for a sports bra if you’ve got the opportunity to grab one from a big box store. But if you can’t, you can acquire a few unused pairs of underwear (you might need a pair larger than you normally wear since this waistband will be going around your chest), cut out the crotch with scissors, put your arms through the leg holes and your head through the newly made crotch hole (this is why we want an unused pair, no skid marks on your neck please). And bingo-bango you’ve got a garment the rough shape and purpose of a bra.

For our purposes we’ll be hand sewing two of them together as we need a pocket for your falsies to dit in and not escape around the side of your chest or out the top if you lay down.

Sew them up the middle from waistband to neck hole, then partially up the side three hand widths (the short length of your hand) from the middle on each side. It doesn’t need to be amazingly done, we’re blocking fairly large objects.

General Method

What you need: 

- 4 large balloons (2 per boob)
- Filler
- Bra

Steps:
1. Take a balloon, insert it into a second balloon (for durability).
2. Fill it with your filler. Fill them to the point where the weight of their contents makes them go flat if put on a surface (or minimal force can squash them). Try to let as much air out of the balloons so it’s just your filler (unless your filler is air). Tie off both balloons together (so there’s only one nipple looking thing).
3. Boobs should generally fill your palm. If once filled and tied off you find them a bit small, you can just have small boobs. Maybe invest in larger balloons or more filler next time.
4. Gently insert your boobs into the pocket (behind the pads if you have pads). You may have to cut the pocket opening to be bigger to fit the boobs in. 
5. Put on the bra.
6. Jostle your boobs to make sure they’re sitting comfortably and aren’t about to shift.
7. Enjoy.

  

Fillers you can use in order of easiest to acquire:

- Air (you might not need to sew a 2nd pair of underwear together to keep the balloon in place cause the latex will have enough friction to stay in place)
	- Easy to acquire
	- Easy to dispose of with little evidence
	- Still needs two balloons for durability
- Water
	- Easy to acquire
	- Looks better when still
	- Can cause issues if it bursts between uses
- Bird seed
	- Features of material
	- Second point
	- Third point

- Silicone water mix
	- Takes a bit of trial and error to get a good texture
- PolyFiller
	- Kinda expensive,
