Introduction:

Are you in possession of a penis? You may be entitled to compensation. Or maybe you don’t want to over-compensate for a lacking one-eyed trouser snake? Or wear tight pants without showing of ol’ one-armed willie? Or have a skirt cling to you in the breeze without showing the telltale girth of a halfmast hammock filler?

Do you want these results without having to shell out for fancy underwear or uncomfortable tape? Do I have the solution for you!!

Taken from the high tech world of digital art, I introduce: Layers!!

OK, but really. What we need to understand here is the difference between how clothes sit on a person’s body and how the follow the contours of that body.

  

Step 1: preparation

Before we start planning what tools we’ll use, first we need to work out what heuristics we want to reach. Cause this isn’t magic. Pop a cubby enough boner and nothing outside of a petticoat will keep that discrete.This is a fashion technique for smoothing out minor bumps and lumps. What often causes dysphoria or a feeling that you don’t ‘pass” in some way is often that you “feel” your junk is on display, even if from a lot of angles it isn’t. From my experience this is cause it pops out from the surrounding body enough that it casts a shadow. So consider darker coloured clothes or stuff with a complex pattern such that small addition blends into the rest of the “visual noise”.

If your downstairs neighbor looks like a baby’s arm holding an apple and tickles the knee, you might just be out of luck with this.
